## Design Decisions

### Color Choices
The color scheme for this web application mockup was inspired by the space itself. The background is an image of space. I have two versions, one that accentuates the color purple in buttons and text for paragraphs while keeping the titles white, and the second one it focuses more on the orange buttons and the text is kept white.

### Font Selections
Headings and titles utilize Montserrat and for paragraphs and body text Libre Franklin that i decided to use for the clean look they have.

### Design Considerations
This design focuses on being interesting to look at so that the people using it can have a fun experience looking at space images and saving their favourite ones without it looking boring.

# Project Report

## Overview

This project aims to create a web application that allows users to explore the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) provided by NASA. Users can view the APOD for any date, add their favorite images to a favorites list, and view them in a modal.

## Steps Taken

1. **Understanding Requirements:** 
   - Read and analyzed the project requirements to identify what I had to do.

3. **Javascript:** 
   - Fetched APOD data from the NASA API based on user input.
   - Dynamically updated HTML to display APOD details.
   - Implemented functionality to add APOD to favorites list stored in localStorage.
   - Created functions to retrieve and display favorite images.
   - Implemented modal functionality for displaying larger images and viewing favorites.

## Challenges Faced

- Implementing localStorage was the thing i found the hardest in the beginning as I found it a bit confusing for storing and retrieving favorite images locally.
- Learning How to display different sections with just one HTML document as it was something I had never don before
- Implementing the modal functionality after clicking in the image was hard as it when it came to making it work in the favourites section.
