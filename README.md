## Design Decisions

### Color Choices
The color scheme for this web application mockup was inspired by the space itself. The background is an image of space. I have two versions, one that accentuates the color purple in buttons and text for paragraphs while keeping the titles white, and the second one it focuses more on the orange buttons and the text is kept white.

### Font Selections
Headings and titles utilize Montserrat and for paragraphs and body text Libre Franklin that i decided to use for the clean look they have.

### Design Considerations
This design focuses on being interesting to look at so that the people using it can have a fun experience looking at space images and saving their favourite ones without it looking boring.
